## 1. Scope and Goals

### 1.1 In Scope

> **Note:** Features are categorized by implementation phase. Status shows both kernel and app readiness.

**Legend:**
- ✅ = Fully implemented
- 🔧 = Partially implemented / needs work  
- ❌ = Not implemented

#### 2D Sketching

| Feature | Kernel | App | Notes |
|---------|--------|-----|-------|
| Lines | ✅ | 🔧 | Creates lines with preview, but NO chain mode (each line is separate) |
| Arcs (3-point) | ✅ | 🔧 | 3-click works, but NO preview arc while placing |
| Circles | ✅ | ❌ | Click twice to create, but NO preview circle, NO radius indicator, ~20% functional |
| Rectangles | ✅ | ❌ | **BROKEN**: Toolbar button creates fixed 4×3 rect at origin, tool mode has no preview |
| Point snapping | ✅ | 🔧 | Snaps to points, but NO visual snap indicator |
| Grid snapping | — | 🔧 | Basic grid snap, but NO grid lines visible in sketch mode |
| Coincident constraint | ✅ | 🔧 | Menu button exists, **NOT TESTED** if it works correctly |
| Horizontal/Vertical | ✅ | 🔧 | Menu button exists, **NOT TESTED** if it works correctly |
| Parallel/Perpendicular | ✅ | 🔧 | Menu button exists, **NOT TESTED** if it works correctly |
| Tangent | ✅ | 🔧 | Menu button exists, **NOT TESTED** |
| Equal/Midpoint | ✅ | 🔧 | Menu button exists, **NOT TESTED** |
| Distance dimension | ✅ | 🔧 | Can create, but input UX is poor |
| Angle dimension | ✅ | ❌ | Menu exists, **likely broken** |
| Inference lines (H/V) | ❌ | ❌ | Not implemented |
| Auto-constraints | ❌ | ❌ | Not implemented |
| Trim | ❌ | ❌ | Not implemented |
| Extend | ❌ | ❌ | Not implemented |
| Offset | ❌ | ❌ | Not implemented |
| Splines | ❌ | ❌ | Future |
| Slots | ❌ | ❌ | Future |
| Construction toggle | ✅ | 🔧 | Button exists, **NOT TESTED** |

> **Reality check:** The constraint menu has buttons but most are **untested**. 
> The `canApplyConstraint` logic may have bugs. Selection of appropriate entities is unclear.

#### Part Features (Solid + Surface)

| Feature | Kernel | App | Notes |
|---------|--------|-----|-------|
| Extrude (Blind) | ✅ | 🔧 | Works, but preview may be inconsistent |
| Extrude (Through All) | ❌ | ❌ | Not implemented |
| Extrude (Up To Face) | ❌ | ❌ | Not implemented |
| Extrude Cut | ✅ | 🔧 | Works via boolean, UX clunky |
| Revolve | ✅ | 🔧 | Works, axis selection is confusing |
| Fillet | ✅ | ❌ | **NO UI AT ALL** - no toolbar button, no dialog |
| Chamfer | ✅ | ❌ | **NO UI AT ALL** - no toolbar button, no dialog |
| Boolean (Union) | ✅ | 🔧 | Auto-selects last 2 bodies, not user-friendly |
| Boolean (Subtract) | ✅ | 🔧 | Same as union |
| Boolean (Intersect) | ✅ | 🔧 | Same as union |
| Face selection | ✅ | ❌ | Click works but **NO UI FEEDBACK** - no "1 Face selected" message |
| Edge selection | ❌ | ❌ | **NOT IMPLEMENTED** - blocks Fillet/Chamfer |
| Sketch on Face | ✅ | ❌ | **REPORTED BROKEN** - face selection doesn't trigger sketch |
| Mirror | ❌ | ❌ | Future |
| Linear Pattern | ❌ | ❌ | Future |
| Circular Pattern | ❌ | ❌ | Future |
| Sweep | ❌ | ❌ | Future |
| Loft | ❌ | ❌ | Future |
| Shell | ❌ | ❌ | Future |
| Draft | ❌ | ❌ | Future |
| Rib | ❌ | ❌ | Future |
| Hole Wizard | ❌ | ❌ | Future |
| Split Line | ❌ | ❌ | Future |

> **Blocking issues:**
> - **Fillet/Chamfer**: Kernel ready, but NO app UI exists at all
> - **Edge selection**: Not implemented, blocks Fillet/Chamfer
> - **Face selection feedback**: Works internally, but user has NO indication it worked
> - **Sketch on Face**: Reported broken - needs investigation

#### Reference Geometry

| Feature | Kernel | App | Notes |
|---------|--------|-----|-------|
| Origin planes (XY/XZ/YZ) | ✅ | ✅ | Works, visible in tree and viewport |
| Origin axes (X/Y/Z) | ✅ | 🔧 | In tree, but visualization may be missing |
| Offset plane | ✅ | 🔧 | Can create, UX for specifying distance unclear |
| Plane from face | ✅ | ❌ | **Blocked**: Face selection has no UI feedback |
| Midplane (2 faces) | ❌ | ❌ | Not implemented |
| Angle plane | ❌ | ❌ | Not implemented |
| 3-point plane | ❌ | ❌ | Not implemented |
| Axis from edge | ❌ | ❌ | **Blocked**: Edge selection not implemented |
| Axis from 2 points | ❌ | ❌ | Not implemented |

#### 3D Selection & Interaction

| Feature | Kernel | App | Notes |
|---------|--------|-----|-------|
| Face hover highlight | ✅ | 🔧 | Renders highlight, but subtle - easy to miss |
| Face click selection | ✅ | ❌ | Click works internally, but **NO UI FEEDBACK** - user doesn't know it worked |
| Face multi-select | ✅ | ❌ | Ctrl+click may work, but impossible to verify without UI feedback |
| Properties panel shows selection | — | ❌ | **NO "Face selected" indicator** anywhere |
| Edge tessellation | ❌ | ❌ | **NOT IN KERNEL** - needs to be added |
| Edge rendering | — | ❌ | Blocked by tessellation |
| Edge hover highlight | — | ❌ | Blocked by tessellation |
| Edge click selection | — | ❌ | Blocked by tessellation |
| Persistent naming | 🔧 | 🔧 | Partial, uses unstable indices currently. See [TOPOLOGICAL-NAMING.md](/TOPOLOGICAL-NAMING.md) |

> **Critical UX gap:** User can click on faces, the system registers it internally,
> but there's **NO VISIBLE INDICATION** that anything was selected. This makes
> "Sketch on Face" impossible to use because users don't know if they selected a face.

#### Workflow Patterns

| Pattern | App | Notes |
|---------|-----|-------|
| Selection-first | ❌ | Selection works but **NO FEEDBACK** - users can't see what's selected |
| PropertyManager panel | 🔧 | Shows feature params, but NO selection info |
| Live preview | 🔧 | Lines have preview; **Missing for**: circle, rectangle, arc |
| In-canvas handles | ❌ | Not implemented |
| Undo/Redo | ✅ | Works via Yjs |
| Multi-user collaboration | ✅ | Works via Yjs |

> **Core UX problem:** The app has backend functionality but users can't **see** 
> what's happening. No previews, no selection indicators, no feedback.

#### Body Types: Solid vs Surface

Following SolidWorks conventions, SolidType distinguishes between **Solid Bodies** and **Surface Bodies**:

| Body Type | Description | Visual | Use Cases |
|-----------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| **Solid Body** | Watertight, enclosed volume | Shaded, opaque | Machined parts, 3D printing, mass properties |
| **Surface Body** | Open faces, no enclosed volume | Slightly transparent or colored edges | Complex shapes, imported geometry, intermediate modeling |

##### SolidWorks Behavior (Reference)

1. **Feature Tree Organization:**
   - Solid bodies appear under "Solid Bodies(n)" folder
   - Surface bodies appear under "Surface Bodies(n)" folder
   - Each body can be renamed, hidden, or deleted independently

2. **Creation:**
   - **Solid features** (Extrude, Revolve, Sweep, Loft) create solid bodies from closed profiles
   - **Surface features** (Extruded Surface, Revolved Surface, etc.) create surface bodies
   - Open sketch profiles create surfaces, closed profiles can create either

3. **Conversion:**
   - `Knit Surface` → combines surfaces into one, optionally creating solid if closed
   - `Thicken` → converts surface to solid by adding thickness
   - `Delete Face` with "Delete and Fill" → can convert solid to surface

4. **Boolean Operations:**
   - Solids can be combined, subtracted, intersected with other solids
   - Surfaces can be trimmed, extended, knitted with other surfaces
   - `Combine` feature works only on solid bodies

5. **Visual Distinction:**
   - Solid bodies: standard shading, thick black edges
   - Surface bodies: often shown with colored edges (orange in SW), slightly transparent

##### SolidType Implementation

| Feature | Kernel | App | Notes |
|---------|--------|-----|-------|
| Solid body creation | ✅ | 🔧 | Extrude/Revolve create solids from closed profiles |
| Surface body creation | ❌ | ❌ | No surface-specific features yet |
| Body type detection | ✅ | ❌ | Kernel has `isShellClosed()`, app doesn't display |
| Body folder in tree | — | ❌ | No "Solid Bodies(n)" / "Surface Bodies(n)" folders |
| Visual distinction | — | ❌ | All bodies rendered identically |
| Thicken surface | ❌ | ❌ | Future |
| Knit surfaces | ❌ | ❌ | Future |

**Kernel Implementation:**
```typescript
// In TopoModel.ts - shells have closed flag
addShell(closed: boolean = false): ShellId;
isShellClosed(id: ShellId): boolean;

// A body is "solid" if ALL its shells are closed
// A body is "surface" if ANY shell is open
```

##### Required UX Work

1. **Bodies Section (separate panel, flat list):**
   - Show all bodies in single flat list (no subgroups)
   - Each body row: name, visibility toggle, color swatch, type badge [Solid]/[Surface]
   - Body selection highlights in viewport and cross-links to Features section

2. **Features Section (separate panel, flat list):**
   - Origin planes as flat list at top (no nesting)
   - Each feature shows which body(s) it affects: `Extrude1 → Body 1`
   - Selecting feature highlights associated body in Bodies section

3. **Properties Panel:**
   - When body selected: show "Type: Solid" or "Type: Surface"
   - Show volume (for solids), surface area, bounding box

4. **Viewport:**
   - Solid bodies: opaque shading, dark edges
   - Surface bodies: edge color tint (e.g., orange), optional transparency
   - Add display mode: "Shaded with Edges" vs "Shaded" vs "Wireframe"

5. **Feature Behavior:**
   - Extrude from closed profile → Solid body
   - Extrude from open profile → **Should create Surface body** (currently fails?)
   - Boolean operations → validate both operands are solids
   - Error message if trying to boolean with surface body

6. **Multi-Body Support:**
   - Features can affect specific bodies (merge scope)
   - "Merge result" checkbox on Boss features
   - Body selection for Cut operations

##### Open Profile Handling (Critical Gap)

Currently, if a user draws an open profile (e.g., an arc) and tries to extrude:

| Current Behavior | Target Behavior (SolidWorks-like) |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| ❌ Fails with error | ✅ Creates surface body |
| User is stuck | User can continue modeling with surfaces |

**Implementation Note:**
- Kernel `extrude()` requires closed profiles for solid bodies
- Need to add "extruded surface" variant for open profiles
- This creates a ruled surface through the profile curve

### 1.1.1 Scope Governance

This UX spec **supersedes** documents in `/plan/*` for UX direction. However:

1. **Kernel parity required:** Do not implement UX for features the kernel doesn't support
2. **Future sections:** Sections marked "Future" describe target behavior for later phases
3. **Graceful degradation:** If a feature is partially supported, document limitations in UI

### 1.2 Success Criteria

| Criterion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Reliable References** | Axes and planes can be defined in multiple ways without dead ends. See [TOPOLOGICAL-NAMING.md](/TOPOLOGICAL-NAMING.md) for persistent naming. |
| **Clear Tool Contracts** | Every tool has clear required inputs, predictable click sequences |
| **Visual Feedback** | Visible preview and direction handles on all operations |
| **Consistent UX** | Same confirm/cancel patterns across all tools |
| **Muscle Memory** | Inference cues, auto-relations, tangent arc gestures, power trim |

---

## 2. Global Interaction Model

### 2.1 Application Modes

| Mode | Description | Available Tools |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Model Mode** | No active sketch | Selection, feature creation, reference geometry |
| **Sketch Mode** | Editing a sketch | Sketch tools active, model entities selectable via filters |
| **Command Active** | Any tool running | Tool captures input, selection boxes accept picks |

### 2.2 Confirmation and Cancellation

| Action | Key/Button | Effect |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Accept | `Enter` / ✅ | Commit feature or finish sketch tool |
| Cancel | `Esc` / ❌ | Revert preview, exit tool |
| Context Menu | Right-click | Show context options + OK/Cancel |

#### Right-Click Precedence Rules

Right-click behavior depends on context. Priority order (highest first):

| Priority | Context | Right-Click Behavior |
|----------|---------|----------------------|
| 1 | **Sketch tool chaining** (line/arc in progress) | End chain (stay in tool, clear start point) |
| 2 | **Second right-click** after chain end | Show sketch context menu |
| 3 | **Entity selected** | Show entity context menu |
| 4 | **Empty canvas** | Show global context menu |

**Example flow for line chain:**
1. Click point A → Click point B → line created, chaining from B
2. Right-click → chain ends (no line from B), still in line tool
3. Right-click again → context menu appears
4. Click elsewhere → new chain starts from new point

### 2.3 Selection Model

#### Preselection Support
If user selects valid inputs (sketch, face, edge, axis) before starting tool:
- Tool auto-fills appropriate selection boxes
- Reduces clicks for common workflows

#### In-Command Selection
- Tool shows selection boxes (Profile, Axis, Direction)
- Valid pick candidates highlighted in viewport
- Focused selection box determines filtering

#### Selection Filters (Toggles)

| Filter | Entities |
|--------|----------|
| Faces | All face types |
| Edges | All edge types |
| Vertices | Points and vertices |
| Sketch Entities | Lines, arcs, circles, etc. |
| Sketch Regions | Closed contours |
| Planes | Reference planes |
| Axes | Reference axes |
| Bodies | Solid and surface bodies |

#### Selection Priority
1. Prefer entity types the focused selection box accepts
2. Allow cycle selection (`Tab`) through candidates under cursor
3. `Ctrl+Click` to toggle selection
4. `Shift+Click` to add to selection

### 2.4 Inference and Snapping (Sketch)

#### Snap Targets

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Endpoints | Start/end of lines and arcs |
| Midpoints | Center of line segments |
| Centers | Circle and arc centers |
| Quadrants | 0°, 90°, 180°, 270° on circles |
| Intersections | Real and inferred crossing points |
| H/V Alignment | Horizontal/vertical to existing points |
| Collinear | Along existing line direction |
| Parallel/Perpendicular | To existing entities |
| Tangent | To arcs and circles |
| Point-on-Curve | Anywhere on a curve |

#### Inference UX Requirements

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Visual Cues | Dashed inference lines, snap glyphs at cursor |
| Relation Preview | Show glyph ("Tangent", "Horizontal", "Coincident") |
| Hysteresis | Once relation appears, don't flicker off until cursor leaves tolerance |
| Intent Zones | Special areas around endpoints for tangent-arc gesture |

### 2.5 Relations/Constraints (Sketch)

- Relations are **first-class objects**:
  - Visible as small glyphs on entities
  - Inspectable in relations panel
- Created via:
  - **Auto-relations** on placement (configurable)
  - **Add Relations** tool (explicit)
- **Delete/disable**:
  - Context menu on relation glyph
  - Display/Delete Relations panel for bulk management

### 2.6 Live Preview Pipeline

Preview must update on:
- Each selection change
- Each numeric input change
- Drag of in-canvas manipulator

Preview degradation:
- If kernel compute is expensive, show approximate preview then refine

---

## 4. Reference Geometry

### 4.1 Plane Tool

**Goal:** Single tool that creates planes from many reference combinations.

#### PropertyManager Structure
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Plane                           │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ Reference 1: [Select...]        │
│ Reference 2: [Select...] (opt)  │
│ Reference 3: [Select...] (opt)  │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ Type: [Auto-detect ▼]           │
│   • Offset                      │
│   • Midplane                    │
│   • Angle                       │
│   • 3-Point                     │
│   • Tangent                     │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ Offset Distance: [____] mm      │
│ Angle: [____]°                  │
│ [Flip Normal] [Reverse]         │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│        [✓ OK]  [✗ Cancel]       │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Accepted References

| Reference Type | Accepted Entities |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Planar surface | `FacePlanar`, `PlaneRef` |
| Linear entity | `EdgeLinear`, `AxisRef`, `SketchLine` |
| Point | `Vertex`, `SketchPoint` |
| Curved surface | `FaceCylindrical`, `FaceConical` (for tangent) |

#### Mode Detection Rules

| Selection | Detected Mode |
|-----------|---------------|
| One planar face/plane | **Offset** (distance=0 initially) |
| Two planar faces/planes | **Midplane** |
| Three points/vertices | **3-Point** |
| Plane + linear entity | **Angle** (angle=0 initially) |
| Cylindrical face + plane/edge | **Tangent** (oriented by second ref) |

#### UX Requirements
- Highlight valid picks for each reference slot
- Always show preview once sufficient refs exist
- Provide **Flip** and numeric inputs
- Quick creation: `Ctrl+Drag` existing plane creates offset (optional enhancement)

### 4.2 Axis Tool

#### PropertyManager Structure
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Axis                            │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ Definition: [Auto-detect ▼]     │
│   • Single linear entity        │
│   • Two points                  │
│   • Two planes (intersection)   │
│   • From cylinder/cone          │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ Reference 1: [Select...]        │
│ Reference 2: [Select...] (opt)  │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│        [✓ OK]  [✗ Cancel]       │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Accepted References

| Method | Accepted Entities |
|--------|-------------------|
| Single linear | `SketchLine`, `EdgeLinear`, `AxisRef` |
| Two points | `Vertex`, `SketchPoint` |
| Two planes | `PlaneRef`, `FacePlanar` |
| Cylinder/Cone | `FaceCylindrical`, `FaceConical` → creates `TempAxis` |

#### Axis Acceptance in Other Tools
Any feature field requiring "Axis" must accept:
- Reference axis
- Temporary axis
- Linear edge
- Sketch centerline

---

## 5. Sketch Environment

### 5.1 Entering Sketch Mode

**Entry Points:**
1. Click **Sketch** then select plane/planar face
2. Preselect plane/face then click **Sketch**

**On Entry:**
- Orient view normal to sketch plane
- Show sketch origin and axes (optional)
- Enable sketch inference and constraints
- Set default tool to Line

### 5.2 Sketch Status Indicators

| Status | Color | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Under-defined | Blue | Geometry can still move |
| Fully defined | Black/Green | All DOF constrained |
| Construction | Dashed Orange | Reference geometry only |
| Over-defined | Red | Conflicting constraints |

### 5.3 Sketch Tool State Machine Pattern

Every sketch entity tool follows:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ S0: Activate Tool                            │
│     └─→ Show HUD prompt: "Select first point"│
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
              │
              ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ S1: Hover                                    │
│     └─→ Show preview + inference             │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
              │
              ▼ (Click)
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ S2: Commit Point/Segment                     │
│     └─→ Apply auto-relations                 │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
              │
              ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ S3: Continue Chain or Complete               │
│     ├─→ Continue → back to S1                │
│     ├─→ Double-click → end chain             │
│     ├─→ Enter → accept                       │
│     └─→ Esc → cancel                         │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 6. Sketch Entities

### 6.1 Line / Centerline / Construction

#### States
| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| S0 | Waiting for first point |
| S1 | Placing next point in chain (with preview) |

#### Point Placement Accepts
- Free space → creates new point
- Existing point/vertex → coincident constraint
- Point on entity → creates point-on-curve + coincident

#### Auto-Relations on Placement
| Condition | Relation Created |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Near horizontal | Horizontal |
| Near vertical | Vertical |
| Aligned with existing line | Collinear |
| Near perpendicular to reference | Perpendicular |
| Near parallel to reference | Parallel |
| Snapping to endpoint | Coincident |

#### Chain Behavior
- After placing second point, remain in S1 to continue polyline
- End chain via: double-click, right-click "End Chain", or `Esc`

#### Line ↔ Tangent Arc Gesture
When current point is an endpoint of an arc/circle or line:
- Moving cursor into "arc intent zone" → shows tangent arc preview
- Moving away → shows line preview
- Click commits whichever preview is active

### 6.2 Rectangle Flyout

|------|--------|
| 1 | Click corner 1 |
| 2 | Click corner 2 |

**Auto-relations:** H/V edges, perpendicular corners

#### Center Rectangle
| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Click center |
| 2 | Click corner |

#### 3-Point Corner Rectangle
| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Click corner A |
| 2 | Click corner B (defines one edge) |
| 3 | Click third point (defines width) |

#### 3-Point Center Rectangle
| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Click center |
| 2 | Click point (half-length direction) |
| 3 | Click point (half-width) |

### 6.3 Circle Flyout

#### Centerpoint Circle
| Step | Action |
|------|--------|

| 3 | Click point 3 |

### 6.4 Arc Flyout

#### 3-Point Arc
| Step | Action | Auto-Relations |
|------|--------|----------------|

| 3 | Click/drag bulge point | Tangent (if near tangent condition) |

#### Centerpoint Arc
| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Click center |
| 2 | Click start point (sets radius) |
| 3 | Click end point (sets angle) |

#### Tangent Arc
**Entry paths:**

1. **Explicit Tangent Arc tool:**
   - Click existing endpoint (must be connected to curve/line)
   - Hover shows tangent arc preview
   - Click to place end

2. **Implicit during Line tool:**
   - At endpoint, hover into arc intent zone
   - Preview becomes tangent arc
   - Click to place

**Tangency direction fix:**
- Context menu: "Reverse Endpoint Tangent" (flips tangent direction)

### 6.5 Slot Flyout

#### Straight Slot
| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Click end 1 |
| 2 | Click end 2 |
| 3 | Set width (drag/click or numeric) |

## 14. Implementation Guide

### 14.0 Feature Identity: ID vs Display Name

> **📘 See also:** [TOPOLOGICAL-NAMING.md § 0.3](/TOPOLOGICAL-NAMING.md#03-feature-identity-uuid-vs-display-name) for how this applies to persistent topological references.

Every feature has two identifiers:

| Property | Purpose | Example | Visible to User? |
|----------|---------|---------|------------------|
| `id` | Internal UUID for references | `"f7a8b3c2-..."` | ❌ Never |
| `name` | User-facing display name | `"Extrude1"` | ✅ Always |

#### Rules

1. **NEVER show `id` in the UI** - it's an internal implementation detail
2. **ALWAYS show `name`** - this is the user-facing identifier
3. **Generate default names** when creating features: `"Sketch1"`, `"Extrude2"`, etc.
4. **Allow renaming** - users can change `name` at any time
5. **Use `id` for references** - stored references (including PersistentRef for faces/edges) must use `id`, not `name`

#### Schema

```typescript
// From schema.ts
export const FeatureBaseSchema = z.object({
  id: UUID,                        // Internal: never display
  type: z.string(),
  name: z.string().optional(),     // Display: always show (generate if missing)
  suppressed: z.boolean().optional(),
  visible: z.boolean().optional(),
});
```

#### Display Name Resolution

When displaying a feature name, always provide a fallback:

```typescript
// CORRECT: Use getDisplayName helper
function getFeatureDisplayName(feature: Feature): string {
  if (feature.name) return feature.name;
  
  // Generate type-based default (never show raw ID)
  const typeNames: Record<string, string> = {
    sketch: "Sketch",
    extrude: "Extrude", 
    revolve: "Revolve",
    plane: "Plane",
    axis: "Axis",
    origin: "Origin",
    fillet: "Fillet",
    chamfer: "Chamfer",
    boolean: "Boolean",
  };
  return typeNames[feature.type] || "Feature";
}

// WRONG: Never fall back to ID
const displayName = feature.name || feature.id; // ❌ BAD
```

#### Where This Applies

| UI Component | Show |
|--------------|------|
| Feature Tree | `name` (with type icon) |
| Properties Panel header | `name` |
| Error messages | `name` ("Extrude1 failed") |
| Selection info | `name` + type |
| Tooltips | `name` |
| Context menus | `name` |
| Reference displays | `name` ("Offset from Plane1") |

#### Name Generation on Create

When creating a new feature, generate a unique name:

```typescript
function generateFeatureName(type: string, existingFeatures: Feature[]): string {
  const prefix = type.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + type.slice(1);
  let maxNum = 0;
  
  for (const feature of existingFeatures) {
    const name = feature.name || "";
    const match = name.match(new RegExp(`^${prefix}(\\d+)$`));
    if (match) {
      maxNum = Math.max(maxNum, parseInt(match[1], 10));
    }
  }
  
  return `${prefix}${maxNum + 1}`;
}

// Usage: generateFeatureName("extrude", features) → "Extrude3"
```

---

### 14.1 Tool Contract Interface

```typescript
interface SketchTool {
  activate(context: ToolContext): void;
  deactivate(): void;
  onHover(rayHit: RayHit, modifiers: Modifiers): void;
  onClick(rayHit: RayHit, modifiers: Modifiers): void;
  onDrag(start: Point, current: Point, modifiers: Modifiers): void;
  onKey(key: string, modifiers: Modifiers): void;
  setParameter(name: string, value: unknown): void;
  getPreviewGeometry(): PreviewGeometry; // Must be fast
  commit(): void; // Creates persistent entities
}
```

### 14.2 Selection Box Contract

```typescript
interface SelectionBox {
  acceptedTypes: EntityType[];
  multiplicity: 'single' | 'multiple';
  chainSelect: boolean;
  filters: SelectionFilter[];
  required: boolean;
  placeholder: string;
  errorMessage: string;
}
```

### 14.3 Inference Engine Contract

```typescript
interface InferenceEngine {
  // Inputs
  cursorPosition: Vec2; // In sketch plane
  existingGeometry: SketchData;
  tolerances: ToleranceSettings;
  
  // Outputs
  snappedPoint: Vec2;
  candidateRelations: RelationCandidate[];
  previewGlyphs: Glyph[];
  inferenceLines: Line[];
  
  // Must support
  hysteresis: boolean;
  intentZones: IntentZone[];
}
```

### 14.4 Persistence and Editability

- Everything created is editable:
  - Sketch entity parameters + relations
  - Feature parameters + references
- Recompute model on edits
- Preserve IDs so downstream references survive
- **Topological naming** ensures face/edge references remain valid across rebuilds. See [TOPOLOGICAL-NAMING.md](/TOPOLOGICAL-NAMING.md) for the algorithm.

## 15. UI Inventory

### 15.1 Top-Level UI Regions

| Region | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **CommandManager** | Tabbed toolbar (Sketch, Features, Surfaces, Reference Geometry) |
| **Bodies Section** | List of solid and surface bodies with visibility controls |
| **Features Section** | Ordered list of features (origin, sketches, operations) |
| **PropertyManager** | Right panel with selection boxes, parameters, OK/Cancel |
| **Graphics Area** | Viewport with previews, manipulators, HUD |
| **Contextual Toolbar** | Near-cursor toolbar on selection |
| **Shortcut Bar (S key)** | Pop-up palette of common commands |

> **Note:** Unlike SolidWorks' unified tree, SolidType has **two separate sections** for Bodies and Features.

### 15.2 UI Structure: Two Separate Sections

> **Note:** Unlike SolidWorks' single unified tree, SolidType uses **two separate UI sections**:
> a **Bodies section** and a **Features section**. These are distinct panels with flat lists (no nesting).

| Body row | Name, visibility toggle, color swatch, type badge [Solid]/[Surface] |
| Click body | Select body, highlight in viewport |
| Right-click body | Context menu: Hide, Show, Delete, Appearance, Select All Faces |
| Double-click name | Inline rename |
| Drag body | Not supported (bodies are results, not reorderable) |

> **No subgroups:** Solid and surface bodies are in the same flat list, distinguished by a type badge or icon.

#### Features Section (Flat List)

| Element | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| Origin planes | Flat list at top (Front, Top, Right) - no nesting |
| Separator | Visual line between origin planes and user features |
| Feature row | Icon, name, target body indicator, status icon |
| Click feature | Select feature, show in Properties Panel |
| Right-click feature | Context menu: Edit, Suppress, Delete, Rollback |
| Double-click feature | Enter edit mode for that feature |
| Drag feature | Reorder (changes evaluation order) |
| Rebuild Gate | Visual marker, features below are not evaluated |

> **No nesting:** Origin planes are a flat list, not nested under an "Origin" folder.

#### Feature → Body Association Display

Each feature shows which body(s) it affects:

```
🔷 Extrude1 → Body 1              ← Creates/modifies Body 1
🔷 Cut1 → Body 1, Body 2          ← Cuts through multiple bodies  
🔷 Fillet1 → Body 1               ← Applied to Body 1
🔶 Extruded Surface1 → Surface 1  ← Creates Surface Body 1
```

#### Current Implementation Status

| Feature | Bodies Section | Features Section | Notes |
|---------|----------------|------------------|-------|
| Panel exists | 🔧 Partial | ✅ Works | Bodies section needs work |
| Body type indicator | ❌ | — | No [Solid]/[Surface] badge |
| Body visibility toggle | ❌ | — | Not implemented |
| Body color/appearance | ❌ | — | Not implemented |
| Body selection feedback | ❌ | — | No visible feedback |
| Origin planes flat list | — | ✅ | Works |
| Feature → Body indicator | — | ❌ | Features don't show target body |
| Feature reordering | — | ❌ | Not implemented |
| Feature status icons | — | 🔧 | Error icons exist, success/warning missing |

#### Interaction Between Sections

| Action | Bodies Section | Features Section |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| Select body | Highlights body | Highlights features that affect it |
| Select feature | Highlights affected body(s) | Shows feature selected |
| Hide body | Body hidden in viewport | Features still visible |
| Suppress feature | Body may change/disappear | Feature shows suppressed icon |
| Delete body | ❓ Behavior TBD | Associated features deleted? |

#### Body Deletion Behavior (Design Decision)

When user deletes a body from Bodies section:

| Option | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **A. Delete body only** | Body removed, features that created it become orphaned |
| **B. Delete body + features** | Body and all features that contributed to it are deleted |
| **C. Suppress features** | Body hidden, contributing features suppressed (non-destructive) |

> **Recommendation:** Option C (Suppress) as default, with Option B available via Shift+Delete

## Appendix: "Glue" Rules That Prevent Dead-Ends

### A. Inline Reference Creation

Any selection box accepting `PlaneRef` or `AxisRef` gets:
- **"+ Create Plane…"** button
- **"+ Create Axis…"** button

On creation OK: return to tool, fill selection box, preserve tool state.

### B. Auto-Chain Selection

When selection box accepts edges/curves with `ChainSelect: yes`:
- Single click selects connected tangent chain
- `Ctrl+Click` adds/removes segments from chain

### C. Region Picking Rules

- Click inside closed loop → selects `SketchRegion`
- If nested loops, click cycles through: outer region → inner void(s)
- "Selected Contours" list shows chosen regions

### D. Defaulting Rules

| Tool | Defaults |
|------|----------|
| Extrude | Direction = sketch normal, End = Blind, Depth = last-used |
| Cut | End = Through All (or last-used) |
| Revolve | If sketch has one centerline, auto-suggest |
| Mirror | Suggest midplane if symmetric part implied |

### E. Consistent Failure UX

When kernel fails:
1. Keep tool open
2. Preserve user selections
3. Highlight failing selections
4. Show one-line reason + suggestion

## 19. Current vs Target Gap Analysis

### 19.1 Line Tool

| Aspect | Current | Target | Gap |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|
| **Chain Mode** | ❌ Each line independent | ✅ Continue from last point | Need to track `lastEndpointId` |
| **Right-Click Finish** | ❌ Not handled | ✅ Ends chain, stays in tool | Add `onContextMenu` handler |
| **Click-Drag** | ❌ Same as click-click | ✅ Single line on release | Track `mouseDownPos` + `isDragging` |
| **Auto H/V** | ❌ None | ✅ Detect near-axis lines | Check angle in `handleMouseUp` |
| **Auto Coincident** | ❌ Point reuse only | ✅ Create constraint | Call `addConstraint` on snap |
| **Visual Inference** | ❌ Only snap indicator | ✅ H/V/∥/⊥ icons | Add inference overlay |

**Current Code Location:** `Viewer.tsx` lines 3016-3050

```typescript
// CURRENT (simplified)
if (sketchMode.activeTool === "line") {
  if (!tempStartPoint) {
    setTempStartPoint({ x, y });  // First click
  } else {
    addLine(startId, endId);      // Second click
    setTempStartPoint(null);      // ❌ Doesn't chain
  }
}
```

**Target Code Pattern:**
```typescript
if (sketchMode.activeTool === "line") {
  if (!tempStartPoint) {
    setTempStartPoint({ x, y, id: snappedId });
  } else {
    const endId = snappedId ?? addPoint(x, y);
    addLine(startId, endId);
    
    // ✅ Auto-constraints
    if (isNearHorizontal(startPt, endPt)) {
      addConstraint({ type: "horizontal", points: [startId, endId] });
    }
    if (snappedId) {
      addConstraint({ type: "coincident", points: [prevEndId, snappedId] });
    }
    
    // ✅ Chain mode: continue from endpoint
    setTempStartPoint({ x: endPt.x, y: endPt.y, id: endId });
  }
}
```

### 19.2 Arc Tool

| Aspect | Current | Target | Gap |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|
| **Order** | start → end → center | center → start → end | Swap click sequence |
| **Tangent Mode** | ❌ Not implemented | ✅ Auto from line endpoint | Add intent zone detection |
| **Direction** | CCW from cross product | Drag side determines | Track cursor relative to chord |
| **3-Point Mode** | ❌ Not available | ✅ Alternative mode | Add mode toggle |

**Current Code Location:** `Viewer.tsx` lines 3052-3077

### 19.3 Rectangle Tool

| Aspect | Current | Target | Gap |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|
| **Modes** | Corner-corner only | + Center, 3-Point | Add mode state |
| **Auto H/V** | ❌ None | ✅ All edges constrained | Add 4 constraints on create |
| **Preview** | ❌ None | ✅ Live rectangle | Add preview line for 4 edges |

**Current Code Location:** `Viewer.tsx` lines 3106-3137

### 19.4 Selection

| Aspect | Current | Target | Gap |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|
| **Multi-Select** | ❌ Single only | ✅ Ctrl+click toggle | Check `e.ctrlKey` modifier |
| **Box Select** | ❌ Not implemented | ✅ Drag to box select | Add selection box state |
| **Shift+Click** | ❌ Not handled | ✅ Add to selection | Check `e.shiftKey` modifier |

**Current Code Location:** `Viewer.tsx` lines 2995-3014

### 19.5 Constraints

| Aspect | Current | Target | Gap |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|
| **Auto on Create** | ❌ None | ✅ H/V/Coincident | Add in entity creation |
| **Visual Glyphs** | ✅ Dimension labels | + Constraint icons | Add glyph sprites |
| **Suppress Ctrl** | ❌ Not implemented | ✅ Ctrl disables auto | Check modifier |

## 20. Implementation Tasks

### Phase A: Line Tool Chain Mode (Foundation)

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours

#### Task A1: Add Chain Mode State
**File:** `packages/app/src/editor/components/Viewer.tsx`

```typescript
// ADD after line 185 (sketch editing state)
const [chainLastEndpoint, setChainLastEndpoint] = useState<{
  x: number;
  y: number;
  id: string;
} | null>(null);
```

#### Task A2: Modify Line Tool Click Handler
**File:** `packages/app/src/editor/components/Viewer.tsx`
**Location:** Inside `handleMouseUp`, around line 3016

**Changes:**
1. After creating line, set `chainLastEndpoint` to the end point
2. On next click, if `chainLastEndpoint` exists, use it as start
3. Clear `chainLastEndpoint` on tool change or Escape

```typescript
// REPLACE the line tool section (lines 3016-3050)
if (sketchMode.activeTool === "line") {
  const nearbyPoint = findNearbyPoint(snappedPos.x, snappedPos.y, POINT_MERGE_TOLERANCE_MM);
  
  // Determine start point (chain mode or fresh start)
  const startSource = chainLastEndpoint || tempStartPoint;
  
  if (!startSource) {
    // First click - set start point
    if (nearbyPoint) {
      setTempStartPoint({
        x: nearbyPoint.x,
        y: nearbyPoint.y,
        id: nearbyPoint.id,
      });
    } else {
      setTempStartPoint({ x: snappedPos.x, y: snappedPos.y });
    }
  } else {
    // Second+ click - create line
    let startId = startSource.id;
    if (!startId) {
      startId = addPoint(startSource.x, startSource.y);
    }

    let endId: string | null = null;
    if (nearbyPoint) {
      endId = nearbyPoint.id;
    } else {
      endId = addPoint(snappedPos.x, snappedPos.y);
    }

    if (startId && endId) {
      addLine(startId, endId);
      
      // Chain mode: set end as new start
      const endPt = nearbyPoint || { x: snappedPos.x, y: snappedPos.y };
      setChainLastEndpoint({ x: endPt.x, y: endPt.y, id: endId });
      setTempStartPoint(null); // Clear initial temp point
    }
  }
  return;
}
```

#### Task A3: Add Right-Click to End Chain
**File:** `packages/app/src/editor/components/Viewer.tsx`
**Location:** After the `onContextMenu` handler (around line 2583)

```typescript
// MODIFY onContextMenu to handle sketch chain finish
const onContextMenu = (e: MouseEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  
  // In sketch mode with line tool: end chain
  if (sketchMode.active && sketchMode.activeTool === "line") {
    setChainLastEndpoint(null);
    setTempStartPoint(null);
    return;
  }
};
```

#### Task A4: Clear Chain on Tool Change
**File:** `packages/app/src/editor/components/Viewer.tsx`
**Location:** In the useEffect that clears tool state (around line 528)

```typescript
// ADD to the existing useEffect
useEffect(() => {
  setTempStartPoint(null);
  setArcStartPoint(null);
  setArcEndPoint(null);
  setCircleCenterPoint(null);
  setChainLastEndpoint(null);  // ADD THIS
}, [sketchMode.active, sketchMode.sketchId, sketchMode.activeTool]); // ADD activeTool
```

#### Task A5: Update Preview Line for Chain Mode
**File:** `packages/app/src/editor/components/Viewer.tsx`
**Location:** Update the preview line effect (around line 537)

```typescript
// MODIFY the preview effect
useEffect(() => {
  if (!sketchMode.active) {
    setPreviewLine(null);
    return;
  }

  // Use chain endpoint if available, otherwise temp start
  const startPt = chainLastEndpoint || tempStartPoint;

  if (sketchMode.activeTool === "line" && startPt && sketchPos) {
    setPreviewLine({
      start: { x: startPt.x, y: startPt.y },
      end: { x: sketchPos.x, y: sketchPos.y },
    });
  } else {
    setPreviewLine(null);
  }
}, [sketchMode.active, sketchMode.activeTool, tempStartPoint, chainLastEndpoint, sketchPos, setPreviewLine]);
```

**Verification Checklist for Phase A:**
- [ ] Click first point → preview line appears
- [ ] Click second point → line created, preview continues from endpoint
- [ ] Click third point → second line created, chained to first
- [ ] Right-click → chain ends, no preview
- [ ] Escape → chain ends, selection cleared
- [ ] Switch to Select tool → chain ends
- [ ] Click existing point → snaps and creates coincident start

---

### Phase B: Auto-Constraints on Line Creation

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours

#### Task B1: Add Inference Detection Functions
**File:** `packages/app/src/editor/components/Viewer.tsx`
**Location:** Add after line 98 (utility functions section)

```typescript
// Angle tolerance for H/V inference (radians)
const HV_INFERENCE_TOLERANCE = 5 * (Math.PI / 180); // 5 degrees

/** Check if a line is near horizontal */
function isNearHorizontal(p1: { x: number; y: number }, p2: { x: number; y: number }): boolean {
  const dx = p2.x - p1.x;
  const dy = p2.y - p1.y;
  const angle = Math.abs(Math.atan2(dy, dx));
  return angle < HV_INFERENCE_TOLERANCE || angle > Math.PI - HV_INFERENCE_TOLERANCE;
}

/** Check if a line is near vertical */
function isNearVertical(p1: { x: number; y: number }, p2: { x: number; y: number }): boolean {
  const dx = p2.x - p1.x;
  const dy = p2.y - p1.y;
  const angle = Math.abs(Math.atan2(dy, dx));
  return Math.abs(angle - Math.PI / 2) < HV_INFERENCE_TOLERANCE;
}
```

#### Task B2: Add Auto-Constraint Setting
**File:** `packages/app/src/editor/contexts/ViewerContext.tsx`

```typescript
// ADD to ViewerState interface
autoConstraints: boolean;

// ADD to initial state
autoConstraints: true,

// ADD action
toggleAutoConstraints: () => void;
setAutoConstraints: (enabled: boolean) => void;
```

#### Task B3: Apply Auto-Constraints in Line Creation
**File:** `packages/app/src/editor/components/Viewer.tsx`
**Location:** Inside the line creation code (Task A2), after `addLine()`

```typescript
if (startId && endId) {
  addLine(startId, endId);
  
  // Auto-constraints (if enabled and Ctrl not held)
  if (viewerState.autoConstraints && !e.ctrlKey) {
    const startPt = startSource;
    const endPt = nearbyPoint || { x: snappedPos.x, y: snappedPos.y };
    
    // Check for horizontal/vertical
    if (isNearHorizontal(startPt, endPt)) {
      addConstraint({ type: "horizontal", points: [startId, endId] });
    } else if (isNearVertical(startPt, endPt)) {
      addConstraint({ type: "vertical", points: [startId, endId] });
    }
    
    // Auto-coincident on snap (only if end snapped to existing point)
    // Note: coincident with start is implicit from chain mode
    if (nearbyPoint && chainLastEndpoint) {
      // This creates a coincident between the chain's previous endpoint
      // and the snapped point (if they're different)
      if (chainLastEndpoint.id !== nearbyPoint.id) {
        addConstraint({ 
          type: "coincident", 
          points: [chainLastEndpoint.id, nearbyPoint.id] 
        });
      }
    }
  }
  
  // Chain mode...
}
```

#### Task B4: Add Inference Visual Overlay
**File:** `packages/app/src/editor/components/Viewer.tsx`
**Location:** Add state for inference display

```typescript
// ADD to state (after line 200)
const [inferenceIndicator, setInferenceIndicator] = useState<{
  type: "horizontal" | "vertical" | "parallel" | "perpendicular" | null;
  position: { x: number; y: number };
} | null>(null);
```

Then update in mousemove handler when line tool is active with a start point.

**Verification Checklist for Phase B:**
- [ ] Draw horizontal line → "H" indicator appears → horizontal constraint created
- [ ] Draw vertical line → "V" indicator appears → vertical constraint created
- [ ] Draw diagonal line → no indicator → no H/V constraint
- [ ] Hold Ctrl while drawing → no auto constraints applied
- [ ] Toggle auto-constraints off → no auto constraints applied
- [ ] Constraint appears in Relations panel after creation

---

### Phase C: Multi-Select Support

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 hours

> **Critical Fix:** Current `togglePointSelection` and `toggleLineSelection` functions
> clear other selection types. This must be fixed for proper multi-select behavior.

#### Task C0: Fix Toggle Selection Functions (Pre-requisite)

**File:** `packages/app/src/editor/contexts/SketchContext.tsx`

The current toggle functions incorrectly clear other selection types:

```typescript
// ❌ CURRENT (BROKEN): Clears lines when toggling points
const togglePointSelection = (pointId: string) => {
  setSelectedPoints(prev => {
    const next = new Set(prev);
    if (next.has(pointId)) next.delete(pointId);
    else next.add(pointId);
    return next;
  });
  setSelectedLines(new Set());  // BUG: This clears lines!
};

// ✅ FIXED: Toggle only affects its own type
const togglePointSelection = (pointId: string) => {
  setSelectedPoints(prev => {
    const next = new Set(prev);
    if (next.has(pointId)) next.delete(pointId);
    else next.add(pointId);
    return next;
  });
  // Do NOT clear other selection types
};

const toggleLineSelection = (lineId: string) => {
  setSelectedLines(prev => {
    const next = new Set(prev);
    if (next.has(lineId)) next.delete(lineId);
    else next.add(lineId);
    return next;
  });
  // Do NOT clear other selection types
};
```

#### Task C1: Modify Click Selection Logic
**File:** `packages/app/src/editor/components/Viewer.tsx`
**Location:** In `handleMouseUp`, select tool section (lines 2995-3014)

```typescript
if (sketchMode.activeTool === "select") {
  const sketch = getSketch();
  if (!sketch) return;

  const tol = POINT_MERGE_TOLERANCE_MM;
  const nearbyPoint = findNearbyPoint(snappedPos.x, snappedPos.y, tol);
  
  if (nearbyPoint) {
    if (e.ctrlKey) {
      // Ctrl+click: toggle selection (preserves other selections)
      togglePointSelection(nearbyPoint.id);
    } else if (e.shiftKey) {
      // Shift+click: add to selection (preserves other selections)
      setSelectedPoints(prev => new Set([...prev, nearbyPoint.id]));
    } else {
      // Plain click: select only this (clear all others)
      setSelectedPoints(new Set([nearbyPoint.id]));
      setSelectedLines(new Set());
      setSelectedConstraints(new Set());
    }
    return;
  }

  const nearbyLine = findNearbyLineInSketch(sketch, snappedPos.x, snappedPos.y, tol);
  if (nearbyLine) {
    if (e.ctrlKey) {
      // Ctrl+click: toggle selection (preserves other selections)
      toggleLineSelection(nearbyLine.id);
    } else if (e.shiftKey) {
      // Shift+click: add to selection (preserves other selections)
      setSelectedLines(prev => new Set([...prev, nearbyLine.id]));
    } else {
      // Plain click: select only this (clear all others)
      setSelectedLines(new Set([nearbyLine.id]));
      setSelectedPoints(new Set());
      setSelectedConstraints(new Set());
    }
    return;
  }

  // Click on empty space: clear selection (unless modifier held)
  if (!e.ctrlKey && !e.shiftKey) {
    clearSketchSelection();
  }
  return;
}
```

**Verification Checklist for Task C0:**
- [ ] Ctrl+click point → point toggles, lines stay selected
- [ ] Ctrl+click line → line toggles, points stay selected
- [ ] Shift+click → adds to selection, doesn't clear others
- [ ] Plain click → clears all, selects only clicked item

#### Task C2: Update SketchContext Toggle Functions
**File:** `packages/app/src/editor/contexts/SketchContext.tsx`
**Location:** Modify `togglePointSelection` and `toggleLineSelection`

```typescript
// MODIFY togglePointSelection (around line 432)
const togglePointSelection = useCallback((pointId: string, additive?: boolean) => {
  setSelectedPoints((prev) => {
    const next = new Set(prev);
    if (next.has(pointId)) {
      next.delete(pointId);
    } else {
      next.add(pointId);
    }
    return next;
  });
  // Only clear lines if not in additive mode
  if (!additive) {
    setSelectedLines(new Set());
    setSelectedConstraints(new Set());
  }
}, []);
```

**Verification Checklist for Phase C:**
- [ ] Click point → only that point selected
- [ ] Ctrl+click another point → both points selected
- [ ] Ctrl+click selected point → deselects it
- [ ] Shift+click point → adds to selection
- [ ] Click empty space → clears selection
- [ ] Ctrl+click empty space → selection unchanged

---

### Phase D: Rectangle with Auto-Constraints

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 hours

#### Task D1: Add Rectangle Constraint Application
**File:** `packages/app/src/editor/contexts/SketchContext.tsx`
**Location:** Modify `addRectangle` function (around line 395)

```typescript
const addRectangle = useCallback(
  (centerX: number, centerY: number, width: number, height: number) => {
    const sketch = getSketchElement();
    if (!sketch) return;

    const halfW = width / 2;
    const halfH = height / 2;

    // Add 4 corner points (bottom-left, bottom-right, top-right, top-left)
    const p1 = addPointToSketch(sketch, centerX - halfW, centerY - halfH);
    const p2 = addPointToSketch(sketch, centerX + halfW, centerY - halfH);
    const p3 = addPointToSketch(sketch, centerX + halfW, centerY + halfH);
    const p4 = addPointToSketch(sketch, centerX - halfW, centerY + halfH);

    // Add 4 lines
    const l1 = addLineToSketch(sketch, p1, p2); // bottom (horizontal)
    const l2 = addLineToSketch(sketch, p2, p3); // right (vertical)
    const l3 = addLineToSketch(sketch, p3, p4); // top (horizontal)
    const l4 = addLineToSketch(sketch, p4, p1); // left (vertical)

    // Add auto-constraints for rectangle
    addConstraintToSketch(sketch, { type: "horizontal", points: [p1, p2] }); // bottom
    addConstraintToSketch(sketch, { type: "horizontal", points: [p3, p4] }); // top
    addConstraintToSketch(sketch, { type: "vertical", points: [p2, p3] });   // right
    addConstraintToSketch(sketch, { type: "vertical", points: [p4, p1] });   // left
    
    // Optional: equal length constraints for square-like rectangles
    // addConstraintToSketch(sketch, { type: "equalLength", lines: [l1, l3] });
    // addConstraintToSketch(sketch, { type: "equalLength", lines: [l2, l4] });
  },
  [getSketchElement]
);
```

**Verification Checklist for Phase D:**
- [ ] Create rectangle → 4 lines created
- [ ] Rectangle has horizontal constraints on top/bottom
- [ ] Rectangle has vertical constraints on left/right
- [ ] Dragging corner maintains rectangle shape (solver works)

---

### Phase E: Arc Tool Improvements

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours

#### Task E1: Add Arc Tool Mode State
**File:** `packages/app/src/editor/contexts/SketchContext.tsx`

```typescript
// ADD to SketchTool type
export type SketchTool = "none" | "select" | "line" | "arc" | "arcCenterpoint" | "arcTangent" | "circle" | "rectangle";

// Or use a separate state for arc mode:
export type ArcMode = "threePoint" | "centerpoint" | "tangent";
```

#### Task E2: Implement Centerpoint Arc Sequence
**File:** `packages/app/src/editor/components/Viewer.tsx`

The centerpoint arc follows: center → start (defines radius) → end (defines angle)

```typescript
if (sketchMode.activeTool === "arcCenterpoint") {
  const nearbyPoint = findNearbyPoint(snappedPos.x, snappedPos.y, POINT_MERGE_TOLERANCE_MM);
  const clickPoint = nearbyPoint
    ? { x: nearbyPoint.x, y: nearbyPoint.y, id: nearbyPoint.id }
    : { x: snappedPos.x, y: snappedPos.y };

  if (!arcCenterPoint) {
    // First click: center
    setArcCenterPoint(clickPoint);
  } else if (!arcStartPoint) {
    // Second click: start point (defines radius)
    setArcStartPoint(clickPoint);
  } else {
    // Third click: end point (defines angle)
    const centerId = arcCenterPoint.id ?? addPoint(arcCenterPoint.x, arcCenterPoint.y);
    const startId = arcStartPoint.id ?? addPoint(arcStartPoint.x, arcStartPoint.y);
    const endId = clickPoint.id ?? addPoint(clickPoint.x, clickPoint.y);

    if (centerId && startId && endId) {
      // Determine CCW based on cursor position relative to center-start line
      const ccw = determineCcw(arcCenterPoint, arcStartPoint, clickPoint);
      addArc(startId, endId, centerId, ccw);
    }

    // Reset for next arc
    setArcCenterPoint(null);
    setArcStartPoint(null);
  }
  return;
}
```

#### Task E3: Implement Tangent Arc Detection
**File:** `packages/app/src/editor/components/Viewer.tsx`

Add intent zone detection in the line tool:

```typescript
// In mousemove handler, when line tool active and near endpoint:
function isInTangentIntentZone(
  cursor: { x: number; y: number },
  endpoint: { x: number; y: number },
  entityDir: { dx: number; dy: number }
): boolean {
  // Check if cursor is:
  // 1. Near the endpoint (within intent radius)
  // 2. On the "arc side" (perpendicular to the entity direction)
  const dist = Math.sqrt((cursor.x - endpoint.x) ** 2 + (cursor.y - endpoint.y) ** 2);
  if (dist > TANGENT_INTENT_RADIUS) return false;
  
  // Check angle between cursor direction and entity direction
  const cursorDir = { dx: cursor.x - endpoint.x, dy: cursor.y - endpoint.y };
  const dot = cursorDir.dx * entityDir.dx + cursorDir.dy * entityDir.dy;
  const cursorMag = Math.sqrt(cursorDir.dx ** 2 + cursorDir.dy ** 2);
  const entityMag = Math.sqrt(entityDir.dx ** 2 + entityDir.dy ** 2);
  
  if (cursorMag < 0.01 || entityMag < 0.01) return false;
  
  const cosAngle = dot / (cursorMag * entityMag);
  // If angle > 45° from extension, we're in arc territory
  return Math.abs(cosAngle) < 0.7;
}
```

**Verification Checklist for Phase E:**
- [ ] Centerpoint arc: click center → click radius point → click end → arc created
- [ ] Arc direction follows cursor position (above/below chord)
- [ ] Tangent arc: after line, moving perpendicular shows arc preview
- [ ] Tangent constraint auto-applied on tangent arc creation

## 21. Code Patterns Reference

### 21.1 Adding a New Sketch Tool

```typescript
// 1. Add to SketchTool type (SketchContext.tsx)
export type SketchTool = "none" | "select" | "line" | "arc" | "circle" | "rectangle" | "newTool";

// 2. Add state variables (Viewer.tsx)
const [newToolState, setNewToolState] = useState<NewToolState | null>(null);

// 3. Add tool button (FloatingToolbar.tsx)
<Tooltip.Root>
  <Tooltip.Trigger
    className={`floating-toolbar-button ${mode.activeTool === "newTool" ? "active" : ""}`}
    onClick={() => toggleTool("newTool")}
  >
    <NewToolIcon />
  </Tooltip.Trigger>
</Tooltip.Root>

// 4. Handle in mouse handlers (Viewer.tsx)
if (sketchMode.activeTool === "newTool") {
  // ... click handling logic
}

// 5. Clear state on tool change (Viewer.tsx useEffect)
useEffect(() => {
  setNewToolState(null);
}, [sketchMode.activeTool]);
```

### 21.2 Adding a New Constraint Type

```typescript
// 1. Add Zod schema (schema.ts)
export const NewConstraintSchema = z.object({
  id: UUID,
  type: z.literal("newConstraint"),
  // ... constraint-specific fields
}).strict();

// 2. Add to union (schema.ts)
export const SketchConstraintSchema = z.union([
  // ... existing
  NewConstraintSchema,
]);

// 3. Add to ConstraintType (SketchContext.tsx)
export type ConstraintType = 
  | "horizontal" | "vertical" | /* ... */ | "newConstraint";

// 4. Add canApplyConstraint logic (SketchContext.tsx)
case "newConstraint":
  return /* selection requirements */;

// 5. Add applyConstraint logic (SketchContext.tsx)
else if (type === "newConstraint") {
  constraint = { type: "newConstraint", /* ... */ };
}

// 6. Add solver support (@solidtype/core)
// In constraints.ts, add error function
// In solver.ts, add to constraint processing
```

### 21.3 Adding Visual Feedback

```typescript
// 1. Add state for visual element
const [visualState, setVisualState] = useState<VisualState | null>(null);

// 2. Create Three.js objects in setup effect
useEffect(() => {
  // Create geometry/material
  const geometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry();
  const material = new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });
  const visual = new THREE.Line(geometry, material);
  visualRef.current = visual;
  sceneRef.current?.add(visual);
  
  return () => {
    sceneRef.current?.remove(visual);
    geometry.dispose();
    material.dispose();
  };
}, []);

// 3. Update in state change effect
useEffect(() => {
  if (!visualRef.current) return;
  
  if (visualState) {
    // Update geometry positions
    visualRef.current.visible = true;
  } else {
    visualRef.current.visible = false;
  }
  needsRenderRef.current = true;
}, [visualState]);
```

## 22. Verification Checklists

### 22.1 Sketch Tool Verification

**For Each Tool:**
- [ ] Tool activates when clicked in toolbar
- [ ] Tool button shows active state
- [ ] Escape clears in-progress operation
- [ ] Escape again deselects, then exits tool
- [ ] Right-click finishes chain (if applicable)
- [ ] Preview appears during operation
- [ ] Snap indicators appear near existing points
- [ ] Grid snap works when enabled
- [ ] Entity created matches preview

### 22.2 Constraint Verification

**For Each Constraint Type:**
- [ ] Constraint appears in dropdown when valid selection exists
- [ ] Constraint grayed out when selection invalid
- [ ] Applying constraint updates geometry immediately
- [ ] Constraint glyph appears on sketch
- [ ] Deleting constraint releases geometry
- [ ] Over-constraint shows error state

### 22.3 Integration Verification

**Document Persistence:**
- [ ] Entities persist after page refresh
- [ ] Constraints persist after page refresh
- [ ] Undo reverts last operation
- [ ] Redo re-applies operation

**Multi-User (if applicable):**
- [ ] Other user sees entities in real-time
- [ ] Constraint changes sync correctly
- [ ] No conflicts on simultaneous edits

---

## 23. Testing Strategy

### 23.1 Unit Tests

**Location:** `packages/core/src/sketch/*.test.ts`

```typescript
// Example: Test constraint solver
describe("Horizontal constraint", () => {
  it("should make two points have same Y coordinate", () => {
    const sketch = new SketchModel(testPlane);
    const p1 = sketch.addPoint(0, 0);
    const p2 = sketch.addPoint(10, 5);
    
    const solver = new ConstraintSolver(sketch);
    solver.addConstraint({ type: "horizontal", points: [p1, p2] });
    
    const result = solver.solve();
    expect(result.status).toBe("success");
    expect(sketch.getPoint(p1)?.y).toBeCloseTo(sketch.getPoint(p2)?.y);
  });
});
```

### 23.2 Integration Tests

**Location:** `packages/app/src/__tests__/`

```typescript
// Example: Test line tool chain mode
describe("Line tool chain mode", () => {
  it("should continue from last endpoint", async () => {
    // Setup
    const { container } = render(<Editor />);
    
    // Activate line tool
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByLabelText("Line"));
    
    // Click first point
    fireEvent.mouseUp(container, { clientX: 100, clientY: 100 });
    
    // Click second point (creates first line)
    fireEvent.mouseUp(container, { clientX: 200, clientY: 100 });
    
    // Click third point (should chain)
    fireEvent.mouseUp(container, { clientX: 200, clientY: 200 });
    
    // Verify two lines created
    const sketch = getActiveSketch();
    expect(sketch.entities.filter(e => e.type === "line")).toHaveLength(2);
  });
});
```

### 23.3 Manual Testing Script

```markdown
## Line Tool Chain Mode Test

1. Open a new document
2. Click XY plane to select it
3. Click "Sketch" to start new sketch
4. Click "Line" tool
5. Click at point A (any location)
6. Move cursor → verify preview line appears
7. Click at point B → verify line A-B created
8. Move cursor → verify preview continues from B
9. Click at point C → verify line B-C created (chained)
10. Right-click → verify chain ends (no preview)
11. Click at point D → verify new chain starts
12. Press Escape → verify chain cleared
13. Press Ctrl+Enter → verify sketch finishes

Expected: Steps 7 and 9 create connected lines without needing to re-click the endpoint.
```

---

## 24. Common Pitfalls

### 24.1 State Management

**Pitfall:** Modifying state in event handlers without considering React's batching.

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Multiple state updates may not batch correctly
setTempStartPoint(null);
setChainLastEndpoint({ x, y, id });
setInferenceIndicator(null);

// ✅ GOOD: Use functional updates or combine into single state
setToolState(prev => ({
  ...prev,
  tempStart: null,
  chainEnd: { x, y, id },
  inference: null,
}));
```

### 24.2 Yjs Transactions

**Pitfall:** Multiple Yjs operations causing multiple rebuilds.

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Each call triggers separate transaction
addPoint(x1, y1);
addPoint(x2, y2);
addLine(p1, p2);
addConstraint({ type: "horizontal", points: [p1, p2] });

// ✅ GOOD: Wrap in single transaction (already handled in featureHelpers)
// Or use batch operations when available
```

### 24.3 Three.js Memory Leaks

**Pitfall:** Not disposing geometries and materials.

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Creates new objects every render
const geometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry();
// ... use it
// geometry never disposed

// ✅ GOOD: Reuse or dispose properly
useEffect(() => {
  const geometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry();
  geometryRef.current = geometry;
  
  return () => {
    geometry.dispose();
  };
}, []);
```

### 24.4 Constraint Solver Performance

**Pitfall:** Re-solving on every mouse move.

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Solve on every move
onMouseMove: () => {
  solver.solve(); // Expensive!
}

// ✅ GOOD: Debounce or only solve on commit
onMouseUp: () => {
  solver.solve(); // Only when done
}
```

### 24.5 Displaying Feature IDs in UI

**Pitfall:** Showing internal UUIDs to users instead of display names.

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Falling back to internal ID (exposes implementation detail)
<span>{feature.name || feature.id}</span>
// Shows: "f7a8b3c2-1234-5678-9abc-def012345678" 😱

// ❌ BAD: Using ID in error messages
throw new Error(`Feature ${feature.id} failed to build`);
// Shows: "Feature f7a8b3c2-1234-5678-9abc-def012345678 failed to build"

// ✅ GOOD: Use display name with type fallback
<span>{getFeatureDisplayName(feature)}</span>
// Shows: "Extrude1" or "Extrude" if no name set

// ✅ GOOD: Error messages use display name
throw new Error(`${getFeatureDisplayName(feature)} failed to build`);
// Shows: "Extrude1 failed to build"
```

**Helper function to use:**

```typescript
function getFeatureDisplayName(feature: Feature): string {
  if (feature.name) return feature.name;
  
  // Type-based fallback (never raw ID)
  const typeNames: Record<string, string> = {
    sketch: "Sketch", extrude: "Extrude", revolve: "Revolve",
    plane: "Plane", axis: "Axis", origin: "Origin",
    fillet: "Fillet", chamfer: "Chamfer", boolean: "Boolean",
  };
  return typeNames[feature.type] || "Feature";
}
```

**Where to look for violations:**
- `FeatureTree.tsx` - node labels
- `PropertiesPanel.tsx` - feature headers
- Error messages in worker and contexts
- Tooltips and context menus

### 24.6 Inconsistent Feature Name Generation

**Pitfall:** Not generating unique default names on feature creation.

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Feature created without name
addFeature({ id: uuid(), type: "extrude", ... });
// Result: Feature shows as "Extrude" or worse, just blank

// ✅ GOOD: Generate unique name at creation time
addFeature({ 
  id: uuid(), 
  type: "extrude",
  name: generateFeatureName("extrude", existingFeatures), // "Extrude1"
  ...
});
```

## 26. 3D Face and Edge Selection

### 26.1 Current Implementation Status

#### Face Selection - Partially Working ✅

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `SelectionContext.tsx` | ✅ Done | `SelectedFace` type, `selectFace()` function |
| `useRaycast.ts` | ✅ Done | Returns faceIndex via triangle picking |
| `Viewer.tsx` click handler | ✅ Done | Calls `selectFace()` on mesh click |
| `Viewer.tsx` hover highlighting | ✅ Done | Renders semi-transparent overlay on hovered face |
| `Viewer.tsx` selection highlight | ✅ Done | Renders selected face with distinct color |
| Kernel `faceMap` generation | ✅ Done | `tessellate.ts` maps triangles to face indices |
| PropertiesPanel | ⚠️ Partial | Shows parent feature but no face-specific info |

#### Edge Selection - NOT Implemented ❌

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `SelectionContext.tsx` types | ✅ Done | `SelectedEdge` type, `selectEdge()` exists |
| Edge tessellation in kernel | ❌ Missing | Only faces tessellated, no edge curves |
| Edge mesh data to viewer | ❌ Missing | No edge line geometry sent |
| Edge rendering in viewer | ❌ Missing | No visible edge lines displayed |
| Edge picking/raycasting | ❌ Missing | Can't select edges |
| Edge hover highlighting | ❌ Missing | No edge highlights |
| Edge selection highlighting | ❌ Missing | No edge selection visuals |
| PropertiesPanel edge info | ❌ Missing | No edge info shown |

### 26.2 Target Behavior

#### Face Selection
- Hover over face → face highlights (semi-transparent overlay)
- Click face → face selected, shown in selection color
- Selected face info shown in Properties Panel (area, normal, adjacent edges)
- Right-click face → context menu (Sketch on Face, Extrude, Offset, etc.)

#### Edge Selection
- Hover near edge → edge highlights (thicker line, different color)
- Click near edge → edge selected
- Hold **Alt** or toggle filter → prioritize edge over face
- Selected edge info shown in Properties Panel (length, type, connected faces)
- Right-click edge → context menu (Fillet, Chamfer, Select Loop, etc.)

#### Multi-Selection
- **Ctrl+Click** → toggle face/edge in selection
- **Shift+Click** → add to selection
- **Click empty space** → clear selection
- Box select (drag) → future enhancement

### 26.4 Implementation Tasks

#### Phase F1: Edge Tessellation via SolidSession API

> **Important:** All OCCT operations must go through `SolidSession` in `@solidtype/core`.
> The worker must NOT import from `kernel/` directly.

**Step F1.1: Add Edge Mesh Type to Core API**

**File:** `packages/core/src/api/types.ts`

```typescript
// NEW: Edge mesh output type (mirrors face Mesh pattern)
export interface EdgeMesh {
  /** Flattened array of edge vertex positions [x1,y1,z1, x2,y2,z2, ...] */
  vertices: Float32Array;
  /** Pairs of indices into vertices defining line segments */
  indices: Uint32Array;
  /** Maps each line segment to its kernel edge ID (stable within session) */
  edgeIds: string[];
  /** Maps each line segment index to its edgeIds array index */
  edgeMap: Uint32Array;
  /** Persistent refs for each edge (for selection storage) */
  persistentRefs: string[];
}
```

**Step F1.2: Add Edge Tessellation to SolidSession**

**File:** `packages/core/src/api/SolidSession.ts`

```typescript
/**
 * Get tessellated edges for rendering (called via worker, not directly in app)
 * Returns line segments with persistent references for selection
 */
tessellateEdges(bodyId: BodyId, quality: TessellationQuality = 'medium'): EdgeMesh {
  this.ensureInitialized();
  
  const body = this.bodies.get(bodyId);
  if (!body) {
    throw new Error(`Body ${bodyId} not found`);
  }
  
  // Delegate to kernel tessellate module (internal)
  const result = tessellateBodyEdges(body, quality);
  
  // Generate persistent refs for each edge
  const persistentRefs = result.edgeIds.map((edgeId, index) => 
    this.getEdgePersistentRef(bodyId, index)
  );
  
  return {
    vertices: result.vertices,
    indices: result.indices,
    edgeIds: result.edgeIds,
    edgeMap: result.edgeMap,
    persistentRefs,
  };
}

/**
 * Get persistent reference string for an edge (survives rebuilds)
 */
getEdgePersistentRef(bodyId: BodyId, edgeIndex: number): string {
  // Format: "edge:<featureId>:<localSelector>:<fingerprint>"
  // This must use the naming system for stability
  return this.namingStrategy.getEdgeRef(bodyId, edgeIndex);
}

/**
 * Get persistent reference string for a face (survives rebuilds)
 */
getFacePersistentRef(bodyId: BodyId, faceIndex: number): string {
  // Format: "face:<featureId>:<localSelector>:<fingerprint>"
  return this.namingStrategy.getFaceRef(bodyId, faceIndex);
}
```

**Step F1.3: Implement Edge Tessellation in Kernel Module**

**File:** `packages/core/src/kernel/tessellate.ts`

```typescript
// Internal function - only called by SolidSession, never imported by app
export function tessellateBodyEdges(
  shape: Shape, 
  quality: TessellationQuality
): { vertices: Float32Array; indices: Uint32Array; edgeIds: string[]; edgeMap: Uint32Array } {
  const oc = getOC();
  const vertices: number[] = [];
  const indices: number[] = [];
  const edgeIds: string[] = [];
  const edgeMap: number[] = [];
  
  const deflection = quality === 'high' ? 0.01 : quality === 'medium' ? 0.05 : 0.1;
  
  const edgeExplorer = new oc.TopExp_Explorer_2(
    shape,
    oc.TopAbs_ShapeEnum.TopAbs_EDGE,
    oc.TopAbs_ShapeEnum.TopAbs_SHAPE
  );
  
  let edgeIndex = 0;
  
  while (edgeExplorer.More()) {
    const edge = oc.TopoDS.Edge_1(edgeExplorer.Current());
    const edgeId = `edge-${edgeIndex}`; // Session-local ID
    edgeIds.push(edgeId);
    
    // Get edge curve and discretize
    const curve = new oc.BRepAdaptor_Curve_2(edge);
    const deflector = new oc.GCPnts_TangentialDeflection_2(
      curve,
      0.1,      // angular deflection (radians)
      deflection,
      2,        // minimum points
      1e-7,     // U tolerance
      100       // max points
    );
    
    const numPoints = deflector.NbPoints();
    const startVertexIdx = vertices.length / 3;
    
    for (let i = 1; i <= numPoints; i++) {
      const pnt = deflector.Value(i);
      vertices.push(pnt.X(), pnt.Y(), pnt.Z());
    }
    
    for (let i = 0; i < numPoints - 1; i++) {
      indices.push(startVertexIdx + i, startVertexIdx + i + 1);
      edgeMap.push(edgeIndex);
    }
    
    deflector.delete();
    curve.delete();
    edgeExplorer.Next();
    edgeIndex++;
  }
  
  edgeExplorer.delete();
  
  return {
    vertices: new Float32Array(vertices),
    indices: new Uint32Array(indices),
    edgeIds,
    edgeMap: new Uint32Array(edgeMap),
  };
}
```

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours

#### Phase F2: Worker Message Types and Edge Data Flow

**Step F2.1: Update Worker Message Types**

**File:** `packages/app/src/editor/worker/types.ts` (create if needed)

```typescript
// Add to existing mesh message type
export interface MeshMessage {
  type: 'meshes';
  bodyId: string;
  featureId: string;
  mesh: {
    positions: Float32Array;
    normals: Float32Array;
    indices: Uint32Array;
    faceMap: Uint32Array;
    // NEW: Persistent refs for faces
    facePersistentRefs: string[];
  };
  // NEW: Edge data
  edges: {
    vertices: Float32Array;
    indices: Uint32Array;
    edgeMap: Uint32Array;
    // NEW: Persistent refs for edges
    edgePersistentRefs: string[];
  };
}
```

**Step F2.2: Call SolidSession from Worker**

**File:** `packages/app/src/editor/worker/kernel.worker.ts`

```typescript
// In mesh generation (after tessellate call):
const faceMesh = session.tessellate(bodyId, 'medium');
const edgeMesh = session.tessellateEdges(bodyId, 'medium');

// Get persistent refs for faces
const facePersistentRefs = Array.from(
  { length: faceMesh.faceMap.length },
  (_, i) => session.getFacePersistentRef(bodyId, faceMesh.faceMap[i])
);

postMessage({
  type: 'meshes',
  bodyId: bodyEntry.id,
  featureId: feature.id,
  mesh: {
    positions: faceMesh.positions,
    normals: faceMesh.normals,
    indices: faceMesh.indices,
    faceMap: faceMesh.faceMap,
    facePersistentRefs,
  },
  edges: {
    vertices: edgeMesh.vertices,
    indices: edgeMesh.indices,
    edgeMap: edgeMesh.edgeMap,
    edgePersistentRefs: edgeMesh.persistentRefs,
  },
});
```

**Step F2.3: Update useKernel Hook**

**File:** `packages/app/src/editor/hooks/useKernel.ts`

```typescript
interface MeshData {
  positions: Float32Array;
  normals: Float32Array;
  indices: Uint32Array;
  faceMap: Uint32Array;
  facePersistentRefs: string[];
  edges: {
    vertices: Float32Array;
    indices: Uint32Array;
    edgeMap: Uint32Array;
    edgePersistentRefs: string[];
  };
}
```

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours

#### Phase F3: Render Edges in Viewer

**File:** `packages/app/src/editor/components/Viewer.tsx`

Add edge line rendering after mesh rendering:

```typescript
// ADD: Edge rendering group ref (after line ~130)
const edgeGroupRef = useRef<THREE.Group | null>(null);

// ADD: useEffect to render edges (after mesh rendering, ~line 870)
useEffect(() => {
  const edgeGroup = edgeGroupRef.current;
  const scene = sceneRef.current;
  if (!edgeGroup || !sceneReady) return;

  // Clear existing edges
  while (edgeGroup.children.length > 0) {
    const child = edgeGroup.children[0];
    edgeGroup.remove(child);
    if (child instanceof THREE.Line) {
      child.geometry.dispose();
      (child.material as THREE.Material).dispose();
    }
  }

  // Render edges for each body
  for (const [bodyId, meshData] of meshes) {
    if (!meshData.edges) continue;
    
    const { vertices, indices } = meshData.edges;
    
    // Create geometry
    const geometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry();
    geometry.setAttribute('position', new THREE.BufferAttribute(vertices, 3));
    geometry.setIndex(new THREE.BufferAttribute(indices, 1));
    
    // Dark edge lines
    const material = new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({
      color: 0x333333,
      linewidth: 1,
    });
    
    const lineSegments = new THREE.LineSegments(geometry, material);
    lineSegments.name = `edges-${bodyId}`;
    lineSegments.renderOrder = 1; // Render on top of faces
    edgeGroup.add(lineSegments);
  }
  
  needsRenderRef.current = true;
}, [meshes, sceneReady]);

// ADD: Create edge group in scene setup (in sceneSetup useEffect, ~line 2450)
const edgeGroup = new THREE.Group();
edgeGroup.name = "edge-lines";
edgeGroup.renderOrder = 1;
scene.add(edgeGroup);
edgeGroupRef.current = edgeGroup;
```

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours

#### Phase F4: Edge Picking Logic with Screen-Space Threshold

> **Important:** Selection thresholds must be computed in screen space, not world space,
> so selection sensitivity is consistent regardless of zoom level.

**File:** `packages/app/src/editor/hooks/useRaycast.ts`

```typescript
export interface RaycastHit {
  bodyId: string;
  featureId: string;
  faceIndex: number;
  point: THREE.Vector3;
  normal: THREE.Vector3 | null;
  distance: number;
  // Persistent reference for the face (survives rebuilds)
  facePersistentRef: string;
  // NEW: Edge info (if edge was closer than face)
  edgeIndex?: number;
  edgeScreenDistance?: number;  // Distance in pixels
  edgePersistentRef?: string;   // Persistent reference for the edge
}

/**
 * Convert world-space distance to approximate screen pixels
 * This ensures consistent selection sensitivity regardless of zoom
 */
function worldToScreenDistance(
  worldPoint: THREE.Vector3,
  worldDistance: number,
  camera: THREE.Camera,
  containerWidth: number
): number {
  // Get distance from camera to point
  const cameraDistance = camera.position.distanceTo(worldPoint);
  
  // For perspective camera, use FOV to compute screen size
  if (camera instanceof THREE.PerspectiveCamera) {
    const vFov = (camera.fov * Math.PI) / 180;
    const worldHeightAtPoint = 2 * cameraDistance * Math.tan(vFov / 2);
    const pixelsPerUnit = containerWidth / (worldHeightAtPoint * camera.aspect);
    return worldDistance * pixelsPerUnit;
  }
  
  // For orthographic camera, use zoom directly
  if (camera instanceof THREE.OrthographicCamera) {
    const worldWidth = (camera.right - camera.left) / camera.zoom;
    const pixelsPerUnit = containerWidth / worldWidth;
    return worldDistance * pixelsPerUnit;
  }
  
  return worldDistance * 100; // Fallback
}

/**
 * Find nearest edge to a point, using screen-space threshold
 */
function findNearestEdge(
  worldPoint: THREE.Vector3,
  meshData: MeshData,
  camera: THREE.Camera,
  containerWidth: number,
  thresholdPixels: number = 8  // 8 pixels is comfortable for mouse selection
): { edgeIndex: number; screenDistance: number; persistentRef: string } | null {
  if (!meshData.edges) return null;
  
  const { vertices, indices, edgeMap, edgePersistentRefs } = meshData.edges;
  let nearestEdge = -1;
  let nearestScreenDistance = Infinity;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < indices.length; i += 2) {
    const i1 = indices[i] * 3;
    const i2 = indices[i + 1] * 3;
    
    const p1 = new THREE.Vector3(vertices[i1], vertices[i1+1], vertices[i1+2]);
    const p2 = new THREE.Vector3(vertices[i2], vertices[i2+1], vertices[i2+2]);
    
    // Distance from point to line segment in world space
    const line = new THREE.Line3(p1, p2);
    const closest = new THREE.Vector3();
    line.closestPointToPoint(worldPoint, true, closest);
    const worldDist = worldPoint.distanceTo(closest);
    
    // Convert to screen space
    const screenDist = worldToScreenDistance(closest, worldDist, camera, containerWidth);
    
    if (screenDist < nearestScreenDistance && screenDist < thresholdPixels) {
      nearestScreenDistance = screenDist;
      nearestEdge = edgeMap[i / 2];
    }
  }
  
  if (nearestEdge >= 0) {
    return { 
      edgeIndex: nearestEdge, 
      screenDistance: nearestScreenDistance,
      persistentRef: edgePersistentRefs[nearestEdge],
    };
  }
  return null;
}
```

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours

#### Phase F5: Selection with Persistent References

> **Critical:** Selection must use persistent references, not tessellation indices.
> Indices are unstable across rebuilds and break downstream features (fillet, chamfer).
> See [TOPOLOGICAL-NAMING.md](/TOPOLOGICAL-NAMING.md) for the complete naming algorithm.

**Step F5.1: Update Selection Context Types**

**File:** `packages/app/src/editor/contexts/SelectionContext.tsx`

```typescript
/** Selected face with persistent reference */
export interface SelectedFace {
  bodyId: string;
  featureId: string;
  // DEPRECATED: Do not use for storage/features - unstable across rebuilds
  faceIndex: number;
  /** Persistent reference string - USE THIS for storage */
  persistentRef: string;
}

/** Selected edge with persistent reference */
export interface SelectedEdge {
  bodyId: string;
  featureId: string;
  // DEPRECATED: Do not use for storage/features - unstable across rebuilds  
  edgeIndex: number;
  /** Persistent reference string - USE THIS for storage */
  persistentRef: string;
}
```

**Step F5.2: Update Selection Handlers in Viewer**

**File:** `packages/app/src/editor/components/Viewer.tsx`

```typescript
const handleClick = (e: MouseEvent) => {
  if (sketchMode.active) return; // Sketch mode handles its own clicks
  
  const hit = raycastRef.current(e.clientX, e.clientY);
  if (!hit) {
    clearFaceSelection();
    return;
  }
  
  const meshData = meshes.get(hit.bodyId);
  if (!meshData) return;
  
  const containerWidth = containerRef.current?.clientWidth || 800;
  
  // Find nearest edge in screen space (8 pixel threshold)
  const nearestEdge = findNearestEdge(
    hit.point, 
    meshData, 
    cameraRef.current!,
    containerWidth,
    8  // pixels
  );
  
  // Edge selection priority:
  // - Alt key held → prefer edge
  // - Edge within 4 pixels → prefer edge  
  // - Otherwise → prefer face
  const preferEdge = e.altKey || (nearestEdge && nearestEdge.screenDistance < 4);
  
  const isMultiSelect = e.ctrlKey || e.metaKey;
  const isAdditive = e.shiftKey;
  
  if (preferEdge && nearestEdge) {
    selectEdgeRef.current({
      bodyId: hit.bodyId,
      edgeIndex: nearestEdge.edgeIndex,
      featureId: hit.featureId,
      persistentRef: nearestEdge.persistentRef,  // Store persistent ref
    }, isMultiSelect, isAdditive);
  } else {
    // Get persistent ref from mesh data
    const faceIndex = getFaceIdRef.current(hit.bodyId, hit.faceIndex);
    const persistentRef = meshData.facePersistentRefs?.[faceIndex] || 
                          `face:${hit.featureId}:${faceIndex}`;
    
    selectFaceRef.current({
      bodyId: hit.bodyId,
      faceIndex,
      featureId: hit.featureId,
      persistentRef,  // Store persistent ref
    }, isMultiSelect, isAdditive);
  }
};
```

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours

#### Phase F6: Edge Highlight Rendering

**File:** `packages/app/src/editor/components/Viewer.tsx`

Add edge highlight rendering (similar to face highlights):

```typescript
// ADD: After face highlight rendering (~line 1040)
// Render selected edges
for (const selected of selectedEdges) {
  const meshData = meshes.get(selected.bodyId);
  if (!meshData?.edges) continue;
  
  const edgeGeometry = extractEdgeSegments(meshData, selected.edgeIndex);
  if (!edgeGeometry) continue;
  
  const geometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry();
  geometry.setAttribute('position', new THREE.BufferAttribute(edgeGeometry.vertices, 3));
  geometry.setIndex(new THREE.BufferAttribute(edgeGeometry.indices, 1));
  
  const material = new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({
    color: 0x00aaff,  // Selection blue
    linewidth: 3,
    depthTest: false,
  });
  
  const highlightLine = new THREE.LineSegments(geometry, material);
  highlightLine.name = `selected-edge-${selected.bodyId}-${selected.edgeIndex}`;
  highlightLine.renderOrder = 101;
  edgeHighlightGroup.add(highlightLine);
}

// ADD: Helper function to extract edge segments
function extractEdgeSegments(
  meshData: MeshData, 
  edgeIndex: number
): { vertices: Float32Array; indices: Uint32Array } | null {
  if (!meshData.edges) return null;
  
  const { vertices, indices, edgeMap } = meshData.edges;
  const segmentIndices: number[] = [];
  
  // Find all segments belonging to this edge
  for (let i = 0; i < edgeMap.length; i++) {
    if (edgeMap[i] === edgeIndex) {
      segmentIndices.push(indices[i * 2], indices[i * 2 + 1]);
    }
  }
  
  if (segmentIndices.length === 0) return null;
  
  return {
    vertices: vertices, // Reuse full vertex array
    indices: new Uint32Array(segmentIndices),
  };
}
```

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours

#### Phase F7: Properties Panel Selection Info

**File:** `packages/app/src/editor/components/PropertiesPanel.tsx`

Add selection info display:

```typescript
// ADD: Component to show face/edge selection info
const SelectionInfo: React.FC<{
  selectedFaces: SelectedFace[];
  selectedEdges: SelectedEdge[];
}> = ({ selectedFaces, selectedEdges }) => {
  if (selectedFaces.length === 0 && selectedEdges.length === 0) {
    return null;
  }
  
  return (
    <div className="properties-panel-selection-info">
      <h4 className="properties-panel-section-title">Selection</h4>
      
      {selectedFaces.length > 0 && (
        <div className="properties-panel-selection-faces">
          <span className="selection-label">
            {selectedFaces.length} Face{selectedFaces.length !== 1 ? 's' : ''} Selected
          </span>
          {selectedFaces.map((face, i) => (
            <div key={i} className="selection-item">
              <span className="selection-item-icon">◻</span>
              <span>Face {face.faceIndex}</span>
            </div>
          ))}
        </div>
      )}
      
      {selectedEdges.length > 0 && (
        <div className="properties-panel-selection-edges">
          <span className="selection-label">
            {selectedEdges.length} Edge{selectedEdges.length !== 1 ? 's' : ''} Selected
          </span>
          {selectedEdges.map((edge, i) => (
            <div key={i} className="selection-item">
              <span className="selection-item-icon">─</span>
              <span>Edge {edge.edgeIndex}</span>
            </div>
          ))}
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

// ADD: In main PropertiesPanel render, before feature content
{selectedFaces.length > 0 || selectedEdges.length > 0 ? (
  <SelectionInfo 
    selectedFaces={selectedFaces} 
    selectedEdges={selectedEdges} 
  />
) : null}
```

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 hours

### 26.5 Verification Checklist

#### Face Selection
- [ ] Hover over face → semi-transparent highlight appears
- [ ] Click face → face selected with distinct highlight color
- [ ] Ctrl+Click → toggle face in selection
- [ ] Shift+Click → add face to selection
- [ ] Click empty space → selection cleared
- [ ] Selected face shows in Properties Panel

#### Edge Selection
- [ ] Visible edges rendered on all bodies
- [ ] Hover near edge → edge highlights
- [ ] Click near edge → edge selected (with Alt key or very close)
- [ ] Click face normally → face selected (not edge)
- [ ] Edge highlight distinct from face highlight
- [ ] Selected edge shows in Properties Panel

#### Multi-Selection
- [ ] Can select multiple faces
- [ ] Can select multiple edges
- [ ] Can select mix of faces and edges
- [ ] Selection persists across view changes

### 26.7 Resolved Design Decisions

1. **Edge selection threshold**: How close must click be to edge?
   - ✅ **Decision:** 8 pixels in screen space (computed via camera projection)
   - See Phase F4 for implementation
   
2. **Hidden edge display**: Show hidden edges as dashed lines?
   - ✅ **Decision:** Future enhancement, not in initial implementation
   
3. **Edge loop selection**: Double-click to select connected edge loop?
   - ✅ **Decision:** Yes, add in Phase F5 extension

4. **Selection filter UI**: Need toggle buttons for Face/Edge/Vertex filters?
   - ✅ **Decision:** Add in toolbar with Phase F5

5. **Persistent naming requirement**: Use indices or persistent refs?
   - ✅ **Decision:** Persistent refs are **essential** from day one
   - Indices are unstable across rebuilds and break downstream features
   - All selection storage must use `persistentRef` field, not `faceIndex`/`edgeIndex`
   - See Phase F5.1 for updated SelectionContext types
   - **Full algorithm:** [TOPOLOGICAL-NAMING.md](/TOPOLOGICAL-NAMING.md)

### 26.8 Persistent Naming Critical Path

> **📘 Full Implementation Plan:** See [TOPOLOGICAL-NAMING.md](/TOPOLOGICAL-NAMING.md) for the comprehensive persistent naming algorithm, data structures, and phased implementation plan.

> **Why this matters:** Without persistent naming, selecting a face for "Sketch on Face"
> will break when the extrude distance changes. The sketch plane reference becomes invalid.

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Implementation Requirement:**

```typescript
// When storing selection for features (e.g., sketch plane, fillet edges):
// ✅ CORRECT: Use persistent ref
sketchFeature.plane = { kind: "faceRef", ref: selectedFace.persistentRef };

// ❌ WRONG: Use index (will break on rebuild)
sketchFeature.plane = { kind: "faceRef", ref: `face:${featureId}:${faceIndex}` };
```
